📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my academic and technical portfolio for ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics. It documents my journey in applying modern data science and machine learning tools to economic questions, with a strong emphasis on both theory-driven reasoning and empirical prediction.

📘 About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student interested in roles at the intersection of AI, data science, and economic analysis. My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional economic theory—such as causal inference, identification, and regression—and modern machine learning techniques that scale these ideas to high-dimensional and real-world data.

This course follows a Concept Extension philosophy:
we begin with foundational statistical methods (e.g., OLS, hypothesis testing, causal models) and progressively extend them using machine learning algorithms such as regularization, cross-validation, and predictive modeling.

Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate how economists can:

Preserve interpretability and causal thinking

While leveraging ML for improved prediction, robustness, and scalability

🧠 What You’ll Find Here

Course labs and assignments

Applied statistical and machine learning models

Experiments combining causal inference with predictive analytics

Clean, reproducible workflows suitable for academic and applied settings

🛠️ Tech Stack

🐍 Python — Core programming language for analysis

📊 Pandas — Data manipulation and exploration

🤖 Scikit-learn — Machine learning models and pipelines

📈 Statsmodels — Statistical modeling and econometric analysis

☁️ Google Colab — Cloud-based experimentation and collaboration

🚀 Looking Ahead

This portfolio is a work in progress. As I continue learning, I will expand this repository with more advanced models, improved documentation, and deeper economic insights. I’m excited to keep exploring how machine learning can enhance economic reasoning—not replace it.
