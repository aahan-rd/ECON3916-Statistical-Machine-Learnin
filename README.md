# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my academic and technical portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. It documents my journey in applying modern data science and machine learning tools to economic questions, with a strong emphasis on both **theory-driven reasoning** and **empirical prediction**.


## 📘 About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student interested in roles at the intersection of **AI, data science, and economic analysis**. My goal is to bridge the gap between **traditional economic theory**—such as causal inference, identification, and regression—and **modern machine learning techniques** that scale these ideas to high-dimensional and real-world data.

This course follows a **Concept Extension** philosophy:  
we begin with foundational statistical methods (e.g., OLS, hypothesis testing, causal models) and progressively extend them using machine learning algorithms such as **regularization, cross-validation, and predictive modeling**.

Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate how economists can:
- Combine causal inference with predictive analytics  
- Maintain interpretability while improving model performance  
- Apply machine learning responsibly to economic data  


## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Course labs and assignments  
- Applied econometric and machine learning models  
- Experiments connecting theory-driven analysis with prediction  
- Reproducible and well-documented workflows  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python**
- 📊 **Pandas**
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn**
- 📈 **Statsmodels**
- ☁️ **Google Colab**



## 🚀 Looking Ahead

This portfolio is an evolving body of work. As I continue learning, I will expand this repository with more advanced models, improved documentation, and deeper economic insights. My long-term goal is to explore how **machine learning can enhance economic reasoning**—not replace it.

Thank you for visiting!
