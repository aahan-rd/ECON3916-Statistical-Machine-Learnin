Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index
Objective

To empirically test the Law of One Price by using the Big Mac Index to evaluate whether exchange rates correctly reflect relative price levels across countries.

Methodology

Collected raw Big Mac price data across countries using The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index, manually structured into Python dictionaries.

Calculated implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. benchmark price.

Computed currency misalignment by comparing implied PPP exchange rates to observed market exchange rates.

Quantified the degree of overvaluation or undervaluation of each currency relative to the U.S. dollar and selected reference currencies.

Key Findings

Several currencies exhibited significant deviations from PPP, suggesting short-run violations of the Law of One Price.

The Norwegian Krone appeared substantially overvalued against the U.S. dollar, indicating that goods in Norway were markedly more expensive than PPP would predict.

In contrast, currencies such as the Argentine Peso showed strong undervaluation, implying that local prices were low relative to the dollar when converted at market exchange rates.

These misalignments highlight the presence of market frictions, non-tradable costs, and limited arbitrage, reinforcing why absolute PPP rarely holds perfectly in practice despite its long-run theoretical appeal.
